			<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, Academinha collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Academinha's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Academinha's visitors use its website. From time to time, Academinha may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>Academinha also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on {{url}} blog posts. Academinha only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to Academinha's websites choose to interact with Academinha in ways that require Academinha to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Academinha gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at {{url}} to provide a username and email address.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2><p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Academinha and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Remarketing">5. Academinha uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
			<p>Academinha uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
			<p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PIIProtection">6. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Academinha discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Academinha's behalf or to provide services available at Academinha's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Academinha's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Academinha will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Academinha discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Academinha believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Academinha, third parties or the public at large.</p>
			<p>If you are a registered user of {{url}} and have supplied your email address, Academinha may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Academinha and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Academinha takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

Cookies</h2><p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Academinha uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
			<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Academinha uses cookies to help Academinha identify and track visitors, their usage of {{url}}, and their website access preferences. Academinha visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Academinha's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Academinha's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

Academinha encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
