			<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, {{title}} collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. {{title}}'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how {{title}}'s visitors use its website. From time to time, {{title}} may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			<p>{{title}} also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on {{url}} blog posts. {{title}} only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to {{title}}'s websites choose to interact with {{title}} in ways that require {{title}} to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that {{title}} gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at {{url}} to provide a username and email address.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2><p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by {{title}} and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
			<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Remarketing">5. {{title}} uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
			<p>{{title}} uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>
			<p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.</p>

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. {{title}} takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
